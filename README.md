# tutorial-data-access-viz
Materials for 2019 Data Access &amp; Basic Visualization tutorials, morning of Day 2

## Schedule: Sequence of presentations/notebooks
We have a block of 3 hours (the whole morning).
1. Introduction. Tutorial goals and landscape of data sources. Presentation. 10min (Emilio)
2. Visualization. Notebooks (Presentation + exercises). 40 min (Filipe)
3. *Break and Q&A. 15 min*
4. Stories. 105 min (team effort). Each story will be presented using 1-2 notebooks, and will serve the dual purpose of presenting good programmatic approaches to access specific, broadly important data sources while introducing the use of relevant Python packages, data structures, and interoperability standards (access protocols, and data and metadata encodings). Stories a-e are 20min each, and f is 5 minutes.
  a. Profiles, casts (CCHDO, etc) (Joseph)
    - Single cast potting (Seabird data, python-ctd)
    - Full line, section plots (CCHDO, some sort of interpolation?…)
      - Single time point
      - differential/anomaly plots
  b. OOI - Mooring array, cabled array (Tim, Filipe, and others)
  c. IOOS - Finding and using diverse data via interoperable standards and tools  (Filipe)
  d. AUVs - Argo floats and Glider-DAC gliders (Filipe, Emilio)
  e. Gridded data - remote sensing (NASA, possibly NOAA) and data products such as GLODAP. (models will be covered in another tutorial). (Emilio, Joseph)
  f. Brief reference to “other” data types? Acoustics, biological data, video/image processing, etc
